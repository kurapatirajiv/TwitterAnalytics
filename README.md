# TwitterAnalytics


Introduction:

The project mainly revolves around most commonly used buzz word in computer industry “Big data”. Big data is a modern day programming paradigm ,which allows processing large data sets for discovering insights of data useful for improving business. 
Most of large enterprise companies started to move from a relational world to a more of Big data world for improving performance and identifying better solutions for real world problems. Primary reasons of picking this field of science because of its learning curve. Hadoop ecosystem components are vast and have a steep curve of learning. 

In this project I have used some advanced programming languages like Scala and large data sets processing engines like Apache Spark to do data analytics on twitter data. The primary reason for picking social media information is due its challenging data structure and its wide range of variety information that is published each day related to different topics. This kind of information is very different from the typical relation world information where the information is strictly schema based. This not only helps me grow as a professional with improved skill set but also gives me a broader picture of real world data analytics.


Project Phases:

i.	Collect Tweets Using Twitter Streaming Api
ii.	Perform Natural language processing on Tweets
iii.	Evaluating tweet texts and Visualizing trend and other insights of data.
